# MarioRLAgent
Re-enforcement Learning Model using Open Gymnasium and PPO Algorithm. 


Remember as a kid how you couldn't really beat this one Mario level and no matter how many times you just failed no matter how close you got? And then you had to call your older sibling to help finish that level...I remember it very very well. Well now, I created a Re-enforcement Learning Model for Mario such that it can play ALL BY ITSELF. Although the one in the repo can't clear the level, you can simply just train the model for around 4000000 steps and it should be able to clear the level.
